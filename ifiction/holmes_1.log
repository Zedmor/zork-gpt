[Press any key.]



You are standing in the spill of a gas streetlight outside Holmes's house. The
street disappears into the fog to the north and south. The door to the house is
to the west.

You have come in response to an urgent summons from your old landlady, Mrs
Hudson. As the fog swirls around you, you huddle into your coat and shiver in
the predawn chill.

>
GPT4: W
IF: The door is not open.

>
GPT4: OPEN THE DOOR
IF: You cannot do that. It is locked.

>
GPT4: KNOCK ON THE DOOR
IF: You hear a bolt sliding back and the door opens to reveal a worried Mrs Hudson.

"Oh Doctor Watson, I'm so glad to see you. It's Mr Holmes, sir. Three days have
come and gone since he's been out of his rooms. He won't eat and I know he
hasn't slept. Now there's a visitor who says he's here about some important
government business. I tried to send him away, but he insisted on waiting in the
parlour. That's when I sent for you. Thank God you've come."

You step inside and Mrs Hudson closes the door behind you. The entry hall is
just as you remember it - small, underheated, and lit by a feeble gas light. The
door to the parlour is to the north, and a flight of well-worn stairs leads up
to the first floor.

GPT4: GO TO THE PARLOUR
IF: [You must be more specific.]

>
GPT4: NORTH
IF: Mrs Hudson apologetically stands in front of the closed door. "I'm terribly
worried about Mr Holmes, Doctor. Won't you please attend to him right away?"

GPT4: GO UPSTAIRS
IF: [You can play the game from start to finish, solve all the puzzles, get all the
points, and STILL never need to use the word "upstairs".]

>
GPT4: GO UP
IF: You climb the stairs and pause outside the door to Holmes's study, nervous about
what you might find inside.

Holmes's study is to the north.

>
GPT4: NORTH
IF: You step back through time to your bachelor days, when you shared these
cluttered digs with the world's only consulting detective. Despite the mess, you
can see that the room is unchanged. The fireplace to the north has a pile of
letters transfixed to its mantelpiece by a jackknife. Next to them lies Holmes's
six-shot revolver, the tobacco slipper, and Holmes's favorite pipe. The violin
has been carelessly tossed onto a stack of obviously unread newspapers.

Holmes is slouched on the sofa, lost in a black mood of despair. He is pale and
emaciated, and his sharp eyes burn with fever. He is staring at a phial that he
holds in one hand. His free hand rests near a hypodermic syringe in a neat
morocco case at his side. You realize that he is fighting a depression brought
on by what he calls "the dull routine of existence."

The bedroom door to the west is closed. The only other exit is the door to the
south.

GPT4: NORTH
IF: You return to Holmes's study, which is in its usual disarray.

Your friend is slouched on the sofa, lost in a black mood of despair. He is pale
and emaciated, and his sharp eyes burn with fever. He is staring at a phial that
he holds in one hand. His free hand rests near a hypodermic syringe in a neat
morocco case at his side. You realize that he is fighting a depression brought
on by what he calls "the dull routine of existence."

The bedroom door to the west is closed. The only other exit is the door to the
south.

You see a newspaper. You see a morocco case on the sofa. Holmes is here. You see
a pipe, a persian slipper, a knife, some mail and a pistol on the mantelpiece.

GPT4: TAKE NEWSPAPER
IF: You take the newspaper.



>
GPT4: READ NEWSPAPER
IF: It's the newspaper that came in your game package.

>
GPT4: SHOW NEWSPAPER TO HOLMES
IF: Holmes glances at the paper and his eye falls on the notice about the Tower of
London. He immediately leaps to his feet and hurls the phial and the case into
the fireplace. The phial and the syringe shatter, and the liquid evaporates
instantly, but the detective does not even notice. "They've closed the Tower?"
he exclaims. "Most singular."



Holmes strides to the door and calls down to Mrs Hudson to bring up a tray of
food. Then he plops back down on the sofa, makes a steeple of his fingertips and
focuses his intense gaze upon you.

>
GPT4: ASK HOLMES ABOUT THE TOWER OF LONDON
IF: "The Tower is the safest stronghold in the nation. Our adversary must be
formidable indeed."

>
GPT4: ASK HOLMES ABOUT THE VISITOR

that he has come because the Crown Jewels have been stolen from the Tower of
London."

>
GPT4: GO SOUTH
IF: You leave the study and pause outside the door. You are on a landing at the top
of the stairs.

Holmes's study is to the north.

Mrs Hudson ushers the visitor into Holmes's study and goes downstairs.

You hear Holmes call you to come back into his study...

>
GPT4: NORTH
IF: >
GPT4: You re-enter the study, anxious to meet the visitor and learn more about the situation.

Holmes is seated on the sofa, focused and alert. The visitor stands near him, noticeably relieved by Holmes's newfound interest in the case.
IF: NORTH


You return to Holmes's study, which is in its usual disarray.

You see a distinguished-looking visitor sitting in the armchair. The bedroom
door to the west is closed. The only other exit is the door to the south.

Holmes is here. You see a pipe, a persian slipper, a knife, some mail and a
pistol on the mantelpiece.

Holmes has seated his visitor and is exchanging pleasantries with him. As you
walk in Holmes looks up and says, "Ah, here you are Watson. Now we can get down
to business." He turns to the gentleman seated in the armchair and says, "I
presume, sir, that you have come about the Jewels."

The visitor half rises from his chair in protest and sputters, "But...but,
how...?"

Holmes calms him with a glance. "Come, sir. What else could it be? The Tower is
suddenly closed, and within hours I receive a call from the highest official of
Her Majesty's government. A simple deduction. Now then, tell me about the
***MORE***theft."

The visitor settles back into his chair and says, "We know very little. Only
that the Crown Jewels were stolen from the Tower sometime Thursday night. The
theft was discovered Friday morning, and we immediately closed and searched the
Tower. All we found was this verse which was left behind in the empty jewel
case."

The visitor removes a folded piece of paper from his pocket and gives it to
Holmes, who glances at it and passes it on to you.

IF: [What?]

GPT4: EXAMINE FOLDED PAPER
IF: [The clue paper]
     Mortality, behold and fear!
     What a change of flesh is here!
     Think how many royal bones
     Sleep within this heap of stones:
     Here they lie, had realms and lands,
     Who now want strength to stir their hands.

              **********

     For two-score years I reigned alone,
     A virgin queen on England's throne.
     My navy caused Armada's shame,
     And with me died the Tudor name.

              **********

     The apple sorely tempted Eve,
     And Tell another aimed to cleave.
     But when one fell, it showed to me,
     The mighty pull of gravity.
***MORE***

              **********

     My father, it was said, would die,
     Beneath the Holy City's sky.
     Jerusalem his body claimed,
     And it is after him I'm named.

              **********

              **********

     O stately Holmes of England,
     In Baker Street abide.
     For even you must surely fail,
     To save your country's pride.

GPT4: ASK HOLMES ABOUT THE VERSE
IF: [You don't need to use the word "folded".]

>

GPT4: ASK HOLMES ABOUT THE PAPER
IF: "Most curious, don't you agree Watson? All thieves unintentionaly leave behind
clues that are discernable to the trained eye. But it is highly irregular for a
thief to taunt the authorities with an actual message. Especially one with
references as obvious as this."

>

GPT4: ASK HOLMES ABOUT REFERENCES IN THE PAPER
IF: [The clue paper]
"Most curious, don't you agree Watson? All thieves unintentionaly leave behind
clues that are discernable to the trained eye. But it is highly irregular for a
thief to taunt the authorities with an actual message. Especially one with
references as obvious as this."

The visitor looks at his pocket watch and stands up. "Thank you, gentlemen. I
must go now. Remember, this calamity can only be hidden from the public until
Monday morning at nine o'clock. If the Regalia is not at Buckingham Palace in
time for the Coronation Day festivities, then all is lost."

The gentleman leaves, and Holmes unlocks the door to the bedroom, goes in, and
reappears moments later wearing his Inverness cape and deerstalker hat.

"Come when you're ready, Watson. I'll wait for you outside."

>

GPT4: GO WEST
IF: [You don't need to use the word "references".]

>

GPT4: GO SOUTH
IF: This is a sparsely furnished room, whose walls are adorned only by scores of
pictures of famous criminals. On a disorderly workbench in the corner, a jumble
of laboratory equipment suggests that Holmes is in the middle of one of his
chemical experiments. Set off to one side is a single ampoule with a neatly
lettered label affixed to it. The room's only exit is to the east.

Next to the bed there is a table, on which you see a lamp and Holmes's favorite
magnifying glass.

>

GPT4: TAKE MAGNIFYING GLASS
IF: You cannot go that way.

>

GPT4: GO EAST
IF: You take the magnifying glass off of the bedside table.



>

GPT4: GO EAST
IF: You return to Holmes's study, which is in its usual disarray.

The bedroom door to the west is open. The only other exit is the door to the
south.

You see a pipe, a persian slipper, a knife, some mail and a pistol on the
mantelpiece.

>

GPT4: GO SOUTH
IF: You would fly out the bow window.

>

GPT4: I apologize for the confusion.

GO SOUTH
IF: You leave the study and pause outside the door. You are on a landing at the top
of the stairs.

Holmes's study is to the north.
